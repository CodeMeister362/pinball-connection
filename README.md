## About ðŸŽ¬

First off this project wouldn't be possible without Scott and Ryan at pinballmachine.com for hosting the free and open API. So, have you ever needed to play some pinball but also had plans to go on a date?  We'll Pinball Connection will help you make connections to the ball while making connections with someone else. Pinball connection is a fun website that lets you find pinball machines in your area and provides a truth or dare challenge, for the person with a lower score, that sparks conversation and connection.

## Context ðŸŽ¬

Pinball Connection was a solo project build during my third semester enrolled in Turing School of Software & Design's Front End Development program, a four- module, seven-month course focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. The project was built to match the specifications of our project [rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html), and represents my last project for this third semester. In addition to challenging us to utilize an API tackle React syntax, conventions, and architecture, Pinball Connection also required the following languages, technologies, and competencies:

Test-Driven Development utilizing the Cypress framework
URL customization and browser compatibility via Router
Object-Oriented Programming
Network requests & API data
Git workflow

## Goals and Challenges ðŸŽ¬

The goals of this project were to utilize the following technologies:
React
Router
Asynchronous JavaScript
End to end testing with Cypress
Create personas and user stories to describe your target audience.

## Future Development Opportunities ðŸŽ¬

Future development would include a map so users can see what machines are closest to them and it would also be great to make POST requests to add new machine locations.
